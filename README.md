# Work-Day-Scheduler
I've been tasked with completing the code for a work scheduler app, particularly the JS and bootstrap side of things. It will display the business hours with a textarea input and save button alongside each business hour. Past, present and future time periods will be colour coded for ease of use.

### How to use
Click on the task description box and enter your task details then click save button to save those details. The page can be refreshed and the content will not be deleted.

### Website Demonstration
